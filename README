Notes on Fairy pieces:


There are puzzles in this set that include fairy pieces:

Due to the large nature of this collection, I can't catalogue every
single case. Please use the wiki entry for further assistance.


Tips for using this collection:

Run the script to make a text file with 100 random puzzles.

Open that text file in vim(or print it out) and work your way through
the list.

Make sure set up on a physical board but you can use chess
software. You will need chess software and an engine like stockfish
to verify the correct answers anyway, but simply working out the
solution for yourself, ideally without moving the pieces, simply using
your mind's eye, will prove to enhance your chess tactics greatly.

If you have a tough problem, it's okay to move around the pieces.

The FEN included in this collection unfortunately don't indicate which
side is to move first. This is a chance to exervice the ability to
look at both sides. I believe most of these begin with white to move,
but there are most likely many with black to move. A strong chess
player can look at the position from both sides to make the first move.

After you have completely worked out a puzzle, verify it by loading the
position into a chess engine and run it for at least 30 seconds for
white to move then do the same for black to move. Many of these
puzzles have multiple solutions so don't beat yourself up if yours
doesn't match.

Fairy puzzle solutions are probably difficult to verify with any
engine. Good luck with those.

Above all, have fun!
